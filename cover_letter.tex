\opening{Hej,}

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Electronics Engineer - Payloads \& Flight Systems at SSC. 
I have more than 4 years of experience conducting research in topics related to cyber security and smart grids. Currently I would like to transition from the academia to the industry, and it would be a privilege to join SSC and help advancing the space industry. 

I have degrees in both Electronic Engineering and Computer Science and have developed competencies in these fields (beyond coursework) through research projects. I also have experience with embedded systems, FPGA development, and $\mu$-processor programming. 
While my coding background is primarily on Python, I am eager to learn new programming languages and other technologies to broaden my technical skill set. 

So far in my career I have conducted research mainly in cyber security and electrical engineering.
This has been a rewarding experience, because each problem is different, and this creates an opportunity to learn new tools. 
I believe that my diverse background and my experience formulating and executing research projects is relevant for this position.

%Although my work experience has been mostly on theoretical research projects, I believe that my diverse background gives me a comprehensive knowledge of electronic systems.
%So far in my career I have conducted research mainly in the intersection of cyber security, electrical engineering, and economics.
%For this reason, in my career I have developed excellent analytical, troubleshooting, and communication skills. 


I have been always fascinated with the aerospace industry, because it inspires impressive scientific and engineering achievements. For this reason, joining SSC would be like a dream, but also, 
%Taking the role of an electronics engineer would be 
a unique opportunity to rediscover my passion for electronic design.


In closing, I believe that this position would be an excellent fit for my background and I am confident that you can find my skills, knowledge, and motivation to learn valuable. I am looking forward to hearing from you.




\closing{Sincerely,}

Recently I learned about SSC thanks to a fortuitous encounter with a group of its employees. 
For me, the aerospace industry has been always a source of inspiration and admiration, because of the impressive engineering achievements and its scientific importance. The friendliness of this group left me with the impression that working in the aerospace industry can be both rewarding and enjoyable. This encounter was also timely, because currently I would like to transition from the academia to the industry, and I think that some engineering positions at SSC would be a perfect fit for my background.

I have background in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science and have developed competencies in these fields (beyond coursework) through research projects. So far in my career I have conducted research mainly in the intersection of cyber security, electrical engineering, and economics. In addition I have experience on embedded systems and hardware design. Although my work experience has been mostly on theoretical research projects, I believe that my diverse background gives me a wide understanding of hardware-based products and the possibility to perform well in different roles. 

In closing, I believe that this position would be an excellent fit for my background and I am confident that you can find my skills, knowledge, and motivation to learn valuable. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
